# Vendure Storefront

This library provides pre-built Angular components and services for creating a storefront application for [Vendure](https://vendure.io).

To get an idea of how to use these components in your application, see the [reference application implementation](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/storefront/tree/master/src/app). This demonstrates a sample Angular CLI app with universal, PWA, and lazy-loaded routes, and is the source of the [Vendure Storefront Demo](https://demo.vendure.io/storefront/)

### Status - experimental

The current API and method of consuming this library is a work-in-progress and need improvement, specifically better separation between the components and the routing defined by the consuming application.

Also a method of overriding default components would be useful to have, if possible.
